Issue Priority, and 4. Issue Category based on the given Context. Context: We have a transport optimization requirement from many of our logistics clients. the goal is to evaluate all the lanes that the carriers could possibly use and provide the most cost-effective ones in terms of the criteria below. 1. lowest lane pricing, 2. highest carrier delivery success rate, and 3. shortest distance. this story will be assigned to development team to implement these criteria. Query: This story is to track the development efforts required to implement the transport optimization requirement. Break down the tasks involved with a high-level estimate to build and test each and every criterion to achieve the optimization","output":"Ticket Title: Develop Transport Optimization Implementation Plan. Description:The purpose of this ticket is to outline the detailed steps for developing an implementation plan aimed at optimizing transportation operations across various lanes by evaluating different options (lowest price, highest delivery success rates, shortest distances) while adhering to specific performance metrics. Acceptance Criteria: The project should include clear documentation outlining the evaluation process. Each task must be completed within specified timeframes. All necessary resources are available before starting work. Documentation includes technical specifications, timelines, milestones, and expected outcomes. Issue Priority: High (Finalization Phase): Development, Comprehensive documentation including technical specs, milestone tracking, and final acceptance report. Issue Category: Project Management & Logistics: Transportation Operations. Business Development: Resource Allocation Strategy"}'
