Query: This story is to track the development efforts required to implement the transport optimization requirement. Break down the tasks involved with a high-level estimate to build and test each and every criterion to achieve the optimization",

Description: The purpose of this ticket is to outline the detailed steps for developing an implementation plan aimed at optimizing transportation operations across various lanes by evaluating different options (lowest price, highest delivery success rates, shortest distances) while adhering to specific performance metrics. Acceptance Criteria: 1. The project should include clear documentation outlining the evaluation process. 2. All the criteria should be taken into consideration to evaluate the lanes. Issue Priority: High (Finalization Phase): Development, Comprehensive documentation including technical specs, milestone tracking, and final acceptance report.

The producer should retry sending the message to the broker with an exponential backoff strategy. This is to ensure that the messages are not lost in case of transient failures. Query: Fix the message loss in the producer application that occurs whenever the Broker is temporarily unavailable. This is resulting in processing failures and customer complaints often",
